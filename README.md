## Hyper Parameter:
  Parameters that are set before even model learning begins and helps in predicting actual parameters or weights of model.
  Hyper paramater tuning is a process of selecting best set of hyper parameters to achieve actual parametes in limtted time.
  There are different ways to select best set of hyper parameters.
  
## Examples of Hyper Parameters:
    1. Learning rate, No of Iterations in Linear Regression
    2. K in K Nearest Neighbours
    3. depth in Decision Tree Classification
    4. kernal, c in SVM
    
### Hyper-Parameter-Tuning
Choosing a set of optimal hyper parameters for a learning algorithm.

### Different ways of hyper parameter tuning techniques.
    1. Manual search
    2. Grid search
    3. Randomized search
    4. Halving Grid search
    5. Halving Randomized search
    6. Bayes Search
    
In this repository, we explore some techniques from scratch using python and numpy and some techniques using sklearn library.
If anyone finds this repository useful don't forgot give it a star..
